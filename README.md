# BMI-Calculator
This is a python script that can calculate users' BMI based on their height in cm and weight in kg. It uses this information to provide feedback on their weight category.

# Use Cases
The BMI Calculator script can be used in various scenarios, including but not limited to:

Personal Health Monitoring: Individuals can use this script to monitor their BMI and maintain awareness of their health status.
Educational Purposes: This script serves as a simple and practical example for those learning Python, showcasing how to handle user input, perform calculations, and implement conditional logic.
Fitness and Wellness Programs: Fitness trainers and wellness programs can use this script to quickly assess the BMI of participants and provide appropriate health advice.

# Python Lessons and Best Practices Applied

Function Definition and Use:
The script defines a function to encapsulate the BMI calculation logic, promoting code reuse and readability.

User Input Handling:
The script uses the input function to gather user input, ensuring that the script is interactive and dynamic.

Type Conversion:
The script converts user inputs to the appropriate data types (e.g., int for weight and height) to ensure accurate calculations.

String Formatting:
The script demonstrates how to concatenate strings and convert numerical values to strings for printing.

Conditional Statements:
The script uses if-elif-else statements to classify the BMI into various weight categories and provide feedback to the user.

Code Readability and Comments:
The script includes a docstring for the BMI calculation function, providing a description of its parameters and return value. This practice enhances code readability and maintainability.

Summary
This project serves as a practical introduction to basic Python programming concepts, including user input handling, type conversion, function definition, and conditional statements. Through this project, learners can gain hands-on experience with writing and organizing Python code effectively while applying best practices in coding.
